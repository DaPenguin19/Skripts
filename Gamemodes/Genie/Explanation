you have three wishes throughout the whole game, but what you can wish for depends on the amount of kills you have at the time. But, you can't wish for something from a lower kill list if you've gotten more kills than that. For example: if you wanted a golden apple from the 0 kill wishlist, but you have 1 kill, you can't. You can only wish for things from the 1 kill wishlist.
