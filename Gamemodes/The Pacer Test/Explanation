logged off after the test started.

/pacertest info/help              - Tells you that The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively 
                                    gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the 
                                    start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] 
                                    A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight 
                                    line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your 
                                    test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
