Diamonds and gold don't drop from ores. The only hostile mobs that spawn are creepers. When a creeper blows up another creeper, diamonds
and gold may drop.

At the top of the skript it lists the chances of diamond/gold dropping. You can change this to your liking; default if 80% for diamonds
and 160% for gold.

Commands:
/creeperchristmas enable/on/true/start   - Enables the scenario
/creeperchristmas disable/off/false/stop - Disables the scenario
