A simple skript to keep track of which episode it is and how much time is left until the next episode.

At the top of the skript it says "PUT PREFIX HERE". This is where you should put the prefix with your RR name. Currently, it is set up 
so that pvp is enabled at the start of episode 2, perma is enabled at the start of episode 5 and meetup is at the start of episode 6.

Commands:
Operators only:
/rrstart    - Starts the timer, heals everyone, clears experience and unfreezes everyone
/rrstop     - Stops the timer
Everyone:
/rrtimer    - Messages you which episode it is and how much time is left until meetup
