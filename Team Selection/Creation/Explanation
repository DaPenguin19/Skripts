Just like in Desire S3, people join teams by going to a 'monument' which has a pressure plate or a button. Activating this pressure plate
or button will add them to a team. The order of which team will get the next player is set to snake draft, meaning that first team 1 will
get a player, then team 2, all the way until each team has a player. After this, it will go the other way.

Credit to TommySX and Desire for coming up with the idea of this gamemode.

This skript uses the variables from D4's team manager. Edits of D4's skript will probably work too.

You need to build the monuments yourself before the game starts. Make sure you have a pressure plate or button hooked up to a command
block with the following command: /creation @p

Commands:
Operators only:
/creation enable/on <number of teams>   - Enables the scenario
/creation disable/off                   - Disables the scenario (This does not delete the teams)
/creation <player>                      - Adds a player to a team (Only use this if the command blocks don't work for some reason)
