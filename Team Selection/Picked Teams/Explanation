There are several empty teams at the beginning, let's call them T1, T2, T3, T4. People in the lobby are randomly chosen to pick 
which team they would like to join and everyone sees their choice. Let's say person X chooses to join team T1. Now everyone sees 
that he is on that team and the next person can either choose to join him or any other team.

This skript has a limit of 8 teams, namely blue, purple, green, orange, pink, red, yellow and light blue. If more are needed, please
let me know! This skript does not use a team manager skript, which means that scattering or team chat will most likely not work. Just
use your own team manager to add everyone to their team after the picking process is finished to deal with that.

At the top of the skript, there is a list of variables which need to be changed to fit your picked teams arena. Here is a quick summary of what they mean:
{PickedTeamsWarp}   - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all players to at the beginning of the picking process
{PickerWarp}        - The coordinates of where you want to teleport the player who is picking their team to
{BlueTeamWarp}      - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the blue team to
{PurpleTeamWarp}    - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the purple team to
{GreenTeamWarp}     - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the green team to
{OrangeTeamWarp}    - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the orange team to
{PinkTeamWarp}      - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the pink team to
{RedTeamWarp}       - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the red team to
{YellowTeamWarp}    - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the yellow team to
{LightBlueTeamWarp} - The coordinates of where you want to teleport all members of the light blue team to

You need to use command blocks to let people choose their team. The command block needs to run the following command:
/pickedteamspick <team colour> @p

Commands:
/pickedteams start <maximum team size>  - Starts the picking process
/pickedteams stop                       - Stops the picking process and resets all teams
/pickedteams pause                      - Stops players from picking a team - effectively pausing the picking process
/pickedteams resume                     - Allows players to pick their team again after the picking process had been paused
/pickedteams add <player>               - Adds a player to the list of players who have yet to pick a team
/pickedteams remove <player>            - Removes a player from the list of players who have yet to pick a team
/pickedteams list                       - Gives a list of all the players and on which team they are
/pickedteams skip                       - Skips the player who is currently the one to pick a team
